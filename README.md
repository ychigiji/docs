# Steps to create github pages:

1. Install the `gh-pages` package: Open your terminal, navigate to your React app's root directory, and install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency: 
	`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`
2. Update package.json: Open your package.json file, which is located in the root directory of your React app. Add the following properties:
`{
  // ...
  "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  },
  // ...
}`
3. Replace "your-username" and "your-repo-name" with your GitHub username and the name of your GitHub repository. The "homepage" property specifies the public URL of your app, and the "predeploy" and "deploy" scripts automate the build and deployment process.

4. Deploy your app:
To deploy your app, run the following command in your terminal, still in your React app's root directory: `npm run deploy`
This command will build your app and deploy it to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package. After running this command, you should see a new gh-pages branch created in your GitHub repository.
5. You'll need to run npm run deploy every time you make changes to your React app to update your GitHub Pages site with the latest version.
